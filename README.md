4D-Tic-Tac-Toe
==============

This project is inspired by a Hackathon problem I did in
Spring 2015 at Loyola University Chicago. The idea is to
create a tic-tac-toe game that is played on a 4-dimensional
hypercube. 

Note that this project is intentionally over-engineered with
Scala generics to experiment with the Scala type system. It
also does not adhere to most of my personal coding standards,
but it will with time.
